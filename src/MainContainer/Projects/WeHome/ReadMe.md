# WeHome

A word play on the iPod/iPhone(/iHome?), weHome syncs your calendar for your whole family of devices, based on your profile and other profiles you allow access to.

For prototyping we are using a json-server as a backend
Future goal is to host the backend on a ASP.Net server running SQL with Entity Framework

# TODO: Sync to your phone's calendar?

Use SQL in the backend
Make Use cases
Make UML 
Authentication in the future

Focus on one thing:

I want to do a GET

Backend application
Storage/Database? Start local, then move maybe to cloud?
Then I can create a controller to get some mock data from the database
